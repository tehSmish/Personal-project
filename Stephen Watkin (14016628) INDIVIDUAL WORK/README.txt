This was part of the development of a 2d shooter game I 
was devloping with a friend, everything in the project is
my own work with e exception of the pixle art.

The project was placed on the backburner when we learned
his university owned the IP of anything he developed 
during his time there. for this reason the project was
halted until his module comes to a close.
